Using Google lookerstudio, I created a report for a shipping company to monitor the distribution and sales of their products. I used column charts, bar charts, tree charts , pie charts, tables, geocharts among others to create this. I also added a customized logo to the report to enhance it's look and added a date range to make it more dynamic. This report can help the company make better and informed decisions for their growth and development.
Here is a link to my report:
